# TicTacToeCodingPractice
Just a simple project I made for fun, creating a tic tac toe game using JS, HTML and CSS

The game runs just as any Tic Tac Toe game would.
Different player profiles indicate which player starts, and the starting player alternates each time a new game is started.
The running scores are held under each player name and will reset if the page is refreshed.
When the game is over, simply press on the 'new game' button to restart the game.

script.js is the original code used for the program. But the new 'scriptTest.js' is a refined, better-made verison of the code and is what is linked to the HTML.

Have Fun!
